# Stock Trading Game

Welcome to the **Stock Trading Game**, a fun and educational way to learn stock trading and investment strategies using a fictional currency. Players can trade stocks of fictional companies and track their performance over time. The game simulates a stock market environment with real-time price updates and allows users to make buy and sell decisions to grow their portfolio.

# Known Issues
There are many known issues that I have found out during development. I can't find them out right now, but anyone exploring the project, please add an issue in the issues tab. I will fix them when I am free.

## Features

- **Two Stock Groups**: Trade stocks in two fictional stock groups: H stock group and A stock group.
- **Real-time Stock Price Updates**: Stock prices update every 5 minutes based on the amount of buys or sells.
- **Buy and Sell Stocks**: Users can buy and sell stocks with a fictional currency.
- **Portfolio Tracking**: Track the value of your portfolio and see how your investments perform over time.
